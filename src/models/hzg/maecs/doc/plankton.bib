	We examined a global ocean ci rculation, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem

	asing latitude, consistent with observations of many marine and terrestrial
	taxa. In the modeled subpolar ocean s, seasonal variability of the
	environment led to competitive exclusion of phytoplankton with slower
	growth rat es and lower diversity. The relatively weak seasonality
	of the stable subtropical and tropical oceans in the gl obal model
	enabled long exclusion time scales and prolonged coexistence of multiple
	phytoplankton with comparab le fitness. Superimposed on the decline
	in diversity seen from equator to pole were hot spots of enhanced
	div ersity in some regions of energetic ocean circulation, which
	reflected lateral dispersal. },

	cascades, and the strength of such effects is influenced by ecosystem
	productivity. To determine whether evolutionary trade-offs among
	plant traits influence patterns of trophic control, we manipulated
	predators and soil fertility and measured impacts of a major herbivore
	(the aphid Aphis nerii) on 16 milkweed species (Asclepias spp. )
	in a phylogenetic field e xperiment. Herbivore density was determined
	by variation in predation and trade-offs between herbivore resistan
	ce and plant growth strategy. Neither herbivore density nor predator
	effects on herbivores predicted the cascad ing effects of predators
	on plant biomass. Instead, cascade strength was strongly and positively
	associated wit h milkweed response to soil fertility. Accordingly,
	contemporary patterns of trophic control are driven by evol utionary
	convergent trade-offs faced by plants. },

	of freshwater algae cultured optimally for use in phys iological
	studies on Daphnia spp. These are listed with other values for freshwater
	algae from the literature, giving a total of 41 dete rminations for
	25 species, together with details of culture media employed, formulae
	used for calculation of volume and techniques for c arbon determination.
	The following significant regression of cell carbon on cell volume
	was fitted to 37 points: C=0. 1204V1. 051 (pg C,{m icro}m3) and the
	regression coefficient was found not to differ significantly from
	1. 0. Significant simple linear and polynomial regress ions could
	also be fitted to the untransformed data. There was a significant
	reduction of residual mean square in the polynomial regress ions
	when tested against the linear regressions and this demonstrated
	the curvilinearity of the relationship. The polynomial regressions
	predicted a more or less constant carbon-volume ratio of [~]0. 2
	pg C {micro}m-3 over the size range of freshwater algae available
	but t he double logarithmic regression was better for comparison.
	The double logarithmic regression is compared with other regressions
	for fre shwater and marine algal species and it appears that freshwater
	and marine species differ in the way carbon content per unit volume
	chan ges with cell size, as this relationship is inverse in marine
	algae. It is suggested that the relationship described here might
	be appli ed to estimate the availability of edible algae in nature
	to herbivorous zooplankton.}
