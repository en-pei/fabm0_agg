@mainpage N2PZDQ: 2-Nutrients, Quota resolveing NPZD model 

@section general-overview General Overview

# Description

## State variables
N2PZDQ model resolves:
- 2 nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus in dissolved and detrital form
- Phytoplankton with flexible C:N:P stoichiometry
- Zooplankton with fixed stoichiometry

## Fluxes
The NPZD (nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus) model described here consists of $I=4$ state variables. Nutrient uptake (phytoplankton growth) is limited by light and nutrient availability, the latter of which is modelled by means of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, see eq.\ (\ref{dnp}). The half-saturation nutrient concentration $\alpha$ used in this formulation has typically a value between 0.2 and 1.5 mmol N\, m$^{-3}$. Zooplankton grazing which is limited by the phytoplankton standing stock is modelled by means of an Ivlev formulation, see eq.\ (\ref{dpz}). All other processes are based on linear first-order kinematics, see eqs.\ (\ref{dpn}) - (\ref{dzd}).

For all details of the NPZD model implemented here, see \cite{Burchardetal2005b}.
